# Humanoid Detection Using Mouse Cursor Movements

## üìã Introduction

This project aims to detect whether the movement of a computer mouse cursor is controlled by a human or an automated bot. By analyzing patterns in cursor movements over time, the program can classify behavior as either human-like or bot-like based on features such as direction changes, velocity variance, and straight-line movements.

The project consists of:
1. **Mouse Movement Detection (`mouse.c`)**: Tracks and analyzes mouse cursor movements for detection.
2. **Mouse Bot Simulation (`mouse_bot.c`)**: Simulates automated mouse movements to test the detection system.

## üìÇ Files

- **`mouse.c`**: The main detection program using the X11 library.
- **`mouse_bot.c`**: A bot script to simulate automated cursor movements.
- **`runboth.sh`**: Shell script to run both programs for testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Ensure that the following libraries are installed:

- **X11 Library**: The code uses the X11 library for mouse event capture. Install it using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libx11-dev

- **POSIX Threads (pthread)**: The project employs multithreading using the pthread library.

## Code Overview
**mouse.c** - Mouse Movement Detection

-The mouse.c program continuously tracks the mouse cursor position and analyzes the movement data to identify patterns that are characteristic of automated scripts (bots). Key features include:

-Mouse Tracking: Uses the X11 library to capture the current mouse cursor position at regular intervals (100 milliseconds).

-Velocity Calculation: Computes the velocity of the cursor based on the distance traveled over time.

-Direction Analysis: Determines the direction of movement and checks for sudden changes.

-Bot Detection Algorithm:

--Straight-Line Movement: Counts the number of intervals where the movement direction remains constant (indicating a straight line).

--Velocity Variance: Calculates the variance of cursor speed. Human movements tend to have a high variance due to natural hand jitter, while bots usually exhibit low variance.

--Detection Criteria: If the straight-line count exceeds a certain threshold and the velocity variance is below a defined limit, the movement is classified as bot-like.


-**Multithreading**: The bot detection algorithm runs in a separate thread, allowing concurrent data analysis without blocking the main thread.
